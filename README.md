# FireMonkey

This repository is a mirror-repository of FireMonkey (Firefox Addon).

If you want to get the original file (contains source-code), download xpi-file from addons.mozilla.org ([FireMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/firemonkey/)).

If you must use files from this repository, clone and zip `firemoneky@eros.man` directory and rename with the `.xpi` extension.

## What is

FireMonkey is a user script manager for Firefox.

## Why is this repository

see [erosman/support/issues/234](https://github.com/erosman/support/issues/234).

If you want to see the source-code, you need to download the addon on addons.mozilla.org and unzip the xpi-file. I hesitate to do this every I wanna see.

## contribution

I do not intend to add any features at this time.
If you have any requests or comments, please comment on [the original support page](https://github.com/erosman/support) or [the addon review page](https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/firemonkey/reviews/).
